Delete Your Account

At TradeZen, we believe you should have full control over your personal data. You can delete your account at any time directly from the Profile section in the app.

When you delete your account, all of your personal data, settings, and any saved information associated with your account will be permanently removed. Please note that this action is irreversible, and once your account is deleted, you will no longer have access to any data or services linked to that account.

How to Delete Your Account:

Navigate to the Profile section in the TradeZen app.
Scroll down to the Account Settings area.
Tap the Delete Account option.
Follow the on-screen instructions to confirm your decision.
If you have any questions or need further assistance with this process, please contact our support team at [Your Support Email].
